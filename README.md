## üéì Projects

### Dare IT Challenge
Participated in the *Dare IT Challenge*, a 7-week QA project program where I learned best practices in testing with support from mentors, culminating in a final GitHub repository assignment. This project involved:

- Writing and documenting automated tests for the **Scouts Panel** test environment.
- Selecting appropriate selectors and developing test cases.


This course concluded with a certificate of completion, which can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8yC6OfnUuzG_qia51aXhFv4tkGq79yJ/view).
